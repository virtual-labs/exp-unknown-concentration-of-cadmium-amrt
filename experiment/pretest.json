      "question": "Which of the following the polarography different from voltammetry?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Helps in determining the electrolysis action of solutions of electroreducible substances.",
        "b": "The working electrode takes the form of a dropping mercury electrode.",
        "c": "All the above.",
        "d": "Helps in determining the electrolysis action of solutions of electrooxidisable substances."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Polarography does analyze electroreducible substances, but it's not the only difference.",
        "b": "This is a specific characteristic of polarography.",
        "c": "Correct. Polarography differs by both analyzing electroreducible/oxidisable substances and using a DME.",
        "d": "Only partially correct. Polarography includes more distinctive features."

      "answers": {
        "a": "Sigmoid in shape",
        "b": "Obtained by plotting the current versus potential response.",
        "c": "Difference exists between potential of reference electrode and DME.",
        "d": "All the above."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct, polarograms are typically S-shaped.",
        "b": "Yes, thatâ€™s how polarograms are generated.",
        "c": "Yes, this is true in polarographic setups.",
        "d": "Correct. All listed are features of a polarogram."
