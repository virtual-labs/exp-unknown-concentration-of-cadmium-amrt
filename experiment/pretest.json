      "question": "Which of the following the polarography different from voltammetry?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Helps in determining the electrolysis action of solutions of electroreducible substances.",
        "b": "The working electrode takes the form of a dropping mercury electrode.",
        "c": "All the above.",
        "d": "Helps in determining the electrolysis action of solutions of electrooxidisable substances."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Polarography does analyze electroreducible substances, but it's not the only difference.",
        "b": "This is a specific characteristic of polarography.",
        "c": "Correct. Polarography differs by both analyzing electroreducible/oxidisable substances and using a DME.",
        "d": "Only partially correct. Polarography includes more distinctive features."

      "question": "Characteristic features of a polarogram is/are",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Sigmoid in shape",
        "b": "Obtained by plotting the current versus potential response.",
        "c": "Difference exists between potential of reference electrode and DME.",
        "d": "All the above."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct, polarograms are typically S-shaped.",
        "b": "Yes, that’s how polarograms are generated.",
        "c": "Yes, this is true in polarographic setups.",
        "d": "Correct. All listed are features of a polarogram."

      "question": "Limiting current in polarogram means",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The sum of the diffusion residual current.",
        "b": "Average diffusion current during the life of the drop.",
        "c": "The current that exist in between the limiting diffusion plateau and the residual current.",
        "d": "Non faradaic current at the foot of the wave."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The limiting current is primarily the diffusion current, which includes the residual component.",
        "b": "Not entirely accurate; diffusion current is the main component but not just the average.",
        "c": "Describes the diffusion current range but not the definition of limiting current.",
        "d": "This defines residual current, not limiting current."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect form, coefficients and powers are inaccurate.",
        "b": "Incorrect exponent format and constants.",

        "a": "Used in the setup but not involved in drop formation.",
        "b": "Common electrode but unrelated to drop control.",
        "c": "Describes the container, not the drop mechanism.",
        "d": "Correct. The capillary tube controls the mercury drop formation."
