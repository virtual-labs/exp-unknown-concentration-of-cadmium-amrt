### Introduction:
 

Jaroslav Heyrovsky received Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1959 for his discovery and development of the polarographic methods of analysis. He is known as the father of electroanalytical method. Polarographic method directly contributed to the development of innovative ideas in electrochemical techniques, instrumentation and applications.

<p>
Voltammetry comprises a group of electroanalytical methods widely employed in analytical chemistry and other industrial processes. 
In voltammetry, the information about the analyte is obtained from the measurement of current as a function of applied potential, 
under the conditions of complete concentration polarization. Voltammetry is widely used by inorganic, physical and biological chemists 
for non-analytical purposes, such as the studies of the oxidation and reduction process, adsorption process in various media, 
and electron transfer processes at chemically modified electron surfaces.
</p>

<p>
Polarography, a branch of voltammetry, is the study of the electrolysis of solutions of electrooxidizable and/or electroreducible substances 
between a dropping mercury electrode (DME) and a reference electrode (RE), which is typically a saturated calomel electrode (SCE). 
This technique falls into the general category of linear-sweep voltammetry, where the electrode potential is usually altered linearly 
from an initial potential to a final potential.
</p>

<p>
In polarography, the working electrode takes the form of a dropping mercury electrode (DME). It consists of about 10 cm of fine capillary tubing 
through which mercury is forced by a mercury head of about 50 cm. The diameter of the capillary tube is adjusted so that a new mercury drop 
forms and breaks at specific intervals, usually every 2 to 6 seconds. A mechanical knocker can control the drop time by dislodging 
the drop at a fixed time after formation.
</p>

<p>
The potential between the reference electrode and the DME is varied, and the resulting change in current flow is measured. Since 
the linear sweep method is governed by a combination of diffusion and convective mass transport, the current versus potential 
response (i-E curve) is known as a <strong>Polarogram</strong>, which is typically sigmoid (S-shaped) in form.
</p>

<p>
The position of a wave in a polarogram along the potential axis provides information on the identity of the substance, 
while the magnitude of the limiting current indicates the concentration of that substance.

Since there is an increased flow of current at the starting region of the polarographic wave there is a marked decrease in the concentration of electro-active substance at the surface of the electrode. With the increase in voltage and current the concentration of the reactive species reaches to a minimal value near to the electrode surface. The current is then limited which depends on the diffusion rate of the reacting species from the solution to the electrode surface. The rapid increase of current at the final stage is due to the supporting electrolyte in the reaction. Since the concentration of the electrolyte is too large within the applied potential range, it will prevent the reactive species to reach the electrode by the electrical migration process, and hence the limiting current is assured as diffusion controlled.

<p>
Residual current is the slowly increasing current at the foot of the wave which is non-faradaic in nature. 
The distance between the limiting diffusion plateau and the residual current is known as <strong>diffusion current (i<sub>d</sub>)</strong>. 
The potential at the midpoint of the wave is represented as <strong>half-wave potential (E<sub>1/2</sub>)</strong>, 
in this region the current is exactly half its limiting value.
</p>

<p>
The limiting current is found to be the sum of the diffusion and residual currents. 
The <strong>wave height</strong> can be calculated by subtracting the residual current from the limiting current.

<p>
The limiting current (the plateau on the sigmoid), called the <strong>diffusion current</strong> since diffusion is the most important contribution to the flux of electroactive material at that point of the Hg drop life, is linked to analyte concentration by the <strong>Ilković equation</strong>:
</p>

$$i_d=708nD^{\frac{1}{2}}m^{\frac{2}{3}}t^{\frac{1}{6}}c$$

<p>
Where:
<ul>
  <li><i>i<sub>d</sub></i> = diffusion current (μA)</li>
  <li><i>n</i> = number of electrons involved in the reaction</li>
  <li><i>D</i> = diffusion coefficient of the analyte (cm²/s)</li>
  <li><i>m</i> = mass flow rate of mercury (mg/s)</li>
  <li><i>t</i> = drop time (s)</li>
  <li><i>c</i> = concentration of the analyte (mol/L)</li>
</ul>
</p>

$$E=E_{1/2}+\frac{0.0591}{n}log\frac{i_d-i}{i}$$
