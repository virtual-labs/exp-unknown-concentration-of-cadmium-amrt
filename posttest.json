      "question": "Limiting current in polarogram means",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The sum of the diffusion residual current.",
        "b": "Average diffusion current during the life of the drop.",
        "c": "The current that exist in between the limiting diffusion plateau and the residual current.",
        "d": "Non faradaic current at the foot of the wave."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The limiting current is primarily the diffusion current, which includes the residual component.",
        "b": "Not entirely accurate; diffusion current is the main component but not just the average.",
        "c": "Describes the diffusion current range but not the definition of limiting current.",
        "d": "This defines residual current, not limiting current."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect form, coefficients and powers are inaccurate.",
        "b": "Incorrect exponent format and constants.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Used in the setup but not involved in drop formation.",
        "b": "Common electrode but unrelated to drop control.",
        "c": "Describes the container, not the drop mechanism.",
        "d": "Correct. The capillary tube controls the mercury drop formation."
